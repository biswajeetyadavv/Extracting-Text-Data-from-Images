### Extracting Text Data from Images

This project demonstrates how to extract text data from images using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The solution is built in **Python** and leverages libraries like **Tesseract** for OCR and **spaCy** for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and extract meaningful information from handwritten or printed text in images.

#### Key Features:
- **Text Extraction**: Converts images of handwritten or printed text into machine-readable data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares text for further analysis.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifies and categorizes key entities (e.g., dates, medical diagnoses) from the extracted text.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved over 90% accuracy in extracting useful information, improving data processing efficiency.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Tesseract OCR**
- **spaCy (NER)**
- **Pandas** for data handling

#### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script to process an image and extract text.
